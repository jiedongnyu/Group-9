Description

Yelp is a great platform for publishing reviews about local business, as well as the online reservation service and online food delivery. Yelp announced its sixth round of Yelp Data Challenge at the beginning of 2015, in which it published a considerable amount of data to the public and challenge the public to use that data in an innovative way and break ground in research. Our project will try to take part in this challenge and our focus will be on understanding user behaviors on Yelp. Specifically, our main goal is to explore datasets given by Yelp and we want to understand the user behavior and find outliers. Since there are almost 366k users in this dataset, it is really hard to recognize some outliers of users. What we will do is to help others spot those outliers in our visualization tool as well as the reason why they are different from others. For instance, maybe a user has written over ten reviews to same business. Once we find outliers, we can explore more about their behaviors from different aspects and possibly spot some ‘bad’ users,like the ones writing fake reviews or spam. Even if at last we still can not explicitly give the definition of ‘fake review’ or distinguish all the ‘fake reviews’ from the normal reviews. By studying user behavior we can help Yelp to better understand about their users, help customers know the reviews written by whom are untrustable, and help business owners to better understand how they are being evaluated and maybe create actions to improve their ratings in Yelp.
